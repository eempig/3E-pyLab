"""
1. There are two types of loops in Python: while and for:

>> the while loop executes a statement or a set of statements as long as a 
specified boolean condition is true, e.g.:
"""

#---------------------------

# Example 1
# while True:
#     print("Stuck in an infinite loop.")

#---------------------------

# Example 2
# counter = 5
# while counter > 2:
#     print(counter)
#     counter -= 1
#---------------------------

"""
>> the for loop executes a set of statements many times; it's used to iterate over 
a sequence (e.g., a list, a dictionary, a tuple, or a set - you will learn about them 
soon) or other objects that are iterable (e.g., strings). You can use the for loop 
to iterate over a sequence of numbers using the built-in range function. Look 
at the examples below:
"""

#---------------------------

# Example 1
# word = "Python"
# for letter in word:
#     print(letter, end="*")

#---------------------------

# Example 2
# for i in range(1, 10):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)

#---------------------------

"""
2. You can use the break and continue statements to change the flow of a loop:

>> You use break to exit a loop, e.g.:
"""

#---------------------------

# Example 1
# text = "OpenEDG Python Institute"
# for letter in text:
#     if letter == "P":
#         break
#     print(letter, end="")

#---------------------------

"""
>> You use continue to skip the current iteration, and continue with the next 
iteration, e.g.:
"""

#---------------------------
#Example 2
# text = "pyxpyxpyx"
# for letter in text:
#     if letter == "x":
#         continue
#     print(letter, end="")

#---------------------------


"""
3. The while and for loops can also have an else clause in Python. The else 
clause executes after the loop finishes its execution as long as it has not 
been terminated by break, e.g.:
"""

#---------------------------

#Example
# n = 0
# while n != 3:
#     print(n)
#     n += 1
# else:
#     print(n, "else")

# print()

# for i in range(0, 3):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print(i, "else")

#---------------------------

"""
4. The range() function generates a sequence of numbers. It accepts integers and 
returns range objects. The syntax of range() looks as follows: range(start, 
stop, step), where:

- start is an optional parameter specifying the starting number of the sequence (0 by default)
- stop is an optional parameter specifying the end of the sequence generated (it is not included),
- and step is an optional parameter specifying the difference between the numbers in the sequence (1 by default.)
"""

#---------------------------

#Example
# for i in range(3):
#     print(i, end=" ")  # Outputs: 0 1 2

# for i in range(6, 1, -2):
#     print(i, end=" ")  # Outputs: 6, 4, 2

Exercise 1

Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

for i in range(1, 11):
    # Line of code.
        # Line of code.

#Sample solution
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i % 2 != 0:

Exercise 2

Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

x = 1
while x < 11:
    # Line of code.

Exercise 3

Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should 
iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ 
symbol, and print the part before @ on one line. Use the skeleton below:

for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org":
    if ch == "@":

Exercise 4

Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. The program 
should iterate over a string of digits, replace each 0 with x, and print the modified 
string to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

    if digit == "0":
